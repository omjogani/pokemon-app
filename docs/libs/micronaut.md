## Micronaut

A Modern, JVM-Based, Full-Stack Framework For Building Modular, Easily Testable Microservice And Serverless Applications.

### Major Focus of Micronaut
- **Low memory footprint and fast startup time**: While everything evaluate at compile time, It has faster startup time.


- **Compile-time dependency injection**: Micronaut utilizes compile-time dependency injection, which means that dependency injection wiring and validation occur at compile time rather than runtime.


- **Micronaut Data**: Micronaut Data is a powerful feature that simplifies database access and management in Micronaut applications.
